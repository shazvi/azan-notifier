azan-notifier
============

A minimalistic azan app for android. The key features are:

- **Persistent notification**
The notification, that will always be visible in the android notification drawer, will be the main interface for the app. The user simply has to swipe down from any screen on the phone to see the upcoming prayer and its time and how much time they have until the next prayer. (This notification can be turned off in the settings, if the user prefers not to have it shown all the time)
- **Perfectly accurate azan times:**
Most azan apps out there calculate azan times based on the user's location by using latitude/longitude of the device. While this allows the app to support many countries, it often makes the prayer times for most countries inaccurate. **Azan Notifier**, however, relies on hardcoded times specific to a local area. This means the prayer times will always be accurate and there will be no need for adjustments to be made.
- **Summary view of full year prayer times**
- **Hijri/Gregorian calendar comparison**
View a year round calendar with hijri and gregorian dates merged into one view for easy comparison
- **Hijri calculator**
See the hijri date for any specified gregorian date
- **Granular control of app behaviour**
You can toggle start up mode, playing azan at azan times, azan volumes, show/hide notifications, show/hide notification tray icon, hijri date adjustments...

Currently, prayer times are available only for Colombo, Sri Lanka. Anybody wishing to include their local prayer times on the app can contact me by email (shazvi@outlook.com). You will have to provide the prayer times for every day of the year. It doesn't matter what format it is provided in. db files, json, pdf, doc, xls, even txt files are fine.
